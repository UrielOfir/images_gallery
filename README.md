I was given a homework assignment that included the following tasks:
Flickr Gallery is a client for the photo-sharing site Flickr. It should fetch and display the most recent public photos uploaded to Flickr. 
 

## Heading

Guidelines:
 - The first screen the user is presented with should host a continuous scrolling list of flickr thumbnails recently loaded to flickr.
 - When a photo thumbnail is clicked the app should open a new screen displaying the specific flickr photo.
-	Make sure your code compiles and knit.




  

## Available scripts to run the code

  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `npm start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

  

The page will reload when you make changes.\

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

  

### `npm test`

  

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  

### `npm run build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

Your app is ready to be deployed!
